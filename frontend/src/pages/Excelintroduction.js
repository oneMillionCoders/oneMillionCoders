        <h2>What is Excel?</h2>
        Excel is pronounced "Eks - sel"<br/>
        It is a spreadsheet program developed by Microsoft. Excel organizes data in columns and rows and allows you to do mathematical functions. It runs on Windows, macOS, Android and iOS.<br/>
        The first version was released in 1985 and has gone through several changes over the years. However, the main functionality mostly remains the same.
